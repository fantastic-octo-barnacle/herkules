/**
 * Serving the built SPA from the same container, with head injection. No repo
 * precedent — `services/web` is a Caddy image with `try_files` — so the shape
 * is stated here:
 *
 *   GET /assets/*                     serveStatic, `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
 *   GET /favicon.*, /robots.txt, /fonts/*   serveStatic, `public, max-age=3600`
 *   GET *                             the SPA document, `cache-control: no-cache`; head injected for
 *                                     /articles/:id and /kb/:name. UNKNOWN ids get the plain shell
 *                                     with status 404 so crawlers do not index them (the SPA renders
 *                                     its own not-found screen; a 404 document is still a document).
 *   GET /api/* | /mcp/* | /assets/* | /fonts/*   never a document. The first two are a JSON 404 so a
 *                                     typo in an `hc` call cannot come back as HTML. The last two are
 *                                     a 404 too, and this one is NOT cosmetic: serveStatic calls next()
 *                                     on a miss, so without this arm a request for a hashed chunk that
 *                                     a deploy removed would fall through to the document and `cached`
 *                                     would stamp it `immutable` — pinning an HTML body under a `.js`
 *                                     URL in the browser and any CDN for a year. 404 + no immutable
 *                                     header lets the client re-fetch the fixed document instead.
 *
 * ROUTE ORDER in app.ts is load-bearing: the fallback is registered LAST, after
 * /healthz, /mcp/bbs, /login, /callback, /logout and /api/*, so it can never
 * shadow them and a 404 from /api/* stays JSON.
 *
 * `webDir === null` (dev) disables all of it: the Vite dev server is the origin
 * and proxies the dynamic paths here. Head injection is therefore NOT exercised
 * in dev, which is why it has its own test against a fixture index.html.
