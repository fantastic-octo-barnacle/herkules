/**
 * THE QUERY LAYER. One module; the REST API (src/api) and the MCP tools
 * (src/mcp) are two presentations of it and hold no SQL of their own.
 *
 * Everything the archive can be asked is twelve methods, each a COMPLETE
 * answer — the caller never composes two calls to get one screen, which is the
 * difference from rm-wenku's `ArticleQuery` (its `/kb/entities/{name}` ran a
 * five-query article fetch per result; its MCP `list_articles` fetched tldrs one
 * row at a time). Query counts per method are part of the contract.
 *
 * Hidden here: keyset cursors, term parsing, bm25-shaped ranking, snippets,
 * jsonb facet cross-filtering, the `status='fetched'` rule that keeps
 * unpublished rows out of every public answer, and which search engine is
 * installed. Exposed: domain query objects in, domain results out. No Drizzle
 * type and no `SQL` value crosses this boundary in either direction.
 *
 * Deliberately not here: writes (v1 has none), auth (callers are verified
 * before they get here; every method is anonymous-safe), caching (the corpus
 * changes only on import), identity (`/api/me` is the oauth-client's and the
 * user-info API's, not the archive's).
 *
 * Module map (src/library):
 *   index.ts    this file — `Library` + createLibrary. The public surface.
 *   types.ts    domain vocabulary.       cursor.ts   opaque keyset codec.
 *   ai-json.ts  lenient AI JSON parse.   articles.ts feed / detail / content / ai / head.
 *   search.ts   the ranked page.         tags.ts / kb.ts / status.ts.
 * Trace for `/api/articles?q=`: api/routes.ts -> articles.ts -> db/search/trgm.ts. Three files.
