 * The services the platform hosts, as the landing page lists them.

 * Checked in here rather than derived from `services/auth/src/registry.ts`:
 * that registry owns OAuth audiences, and status and ops are not resources —
 * they are sites, with no token and no `aud`. Adding one here is a line and a
 * deploy; adding one there is a security boundary.
 *
 * Hosts are subdomains of whatever origin the browser is on, so the built
 * bundle carries no hostname and a deploy to a different domain needs no
 * rebuild — the same rule `api.ts` follows for the auth service.
